# mini-project-1
A project for applying and practicing skills in basic static frontend development with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

## Goal
The goal of the project is to create 2 pages. Each page has a specific function, which will be as follows:

### index.html
The homepage, commonly named as the "index" page, will contain four links leading to the other pages. For the
design of this page, make sure that the links are centered horizontally and vertically, and are oriented in a
2 by 2 layout.  

##### Example:  
Link1 | Link2  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=  
Link3 | Link 4

### get_data.html
In this page, you will input an id which will be inside MOCK_DATA.csv (the id will range from 1 - 100). On click of a submit button, the page will output all of the data related to that id. For the design, put the input field and the submit button on the left half of the page, and put the outputs on the right half of the page.

## UI/UX
Apart from the required design specifications, you are also required to improve the UI/UX of the project which will be rated and approved by your mentor. All custom styles should be put inside style.css in the css folder. All css frameworks should also be inside this folder in a separate file (e.g. bootstrap.css).

## JavaScript Files
All JavaScript files should be inside the js folder. There should be no inline scripts within the html file.
